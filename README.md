# To The Skies!
To The Skies! is a side-scrolling, 3D, single player game prototype developed in Unity. The game lets the player choose 4 classic RPG archetypes to use while battling enemies in the sky. It has a trait system, allowing the player to customize the character to suit their playstyle. The game is developed by Jana Austria and myself. It is currently on halt.
